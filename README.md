This project demonstrates advanced SQL techniques for analyzing e-commerce data using BigQuery. The analysis focuses on customer behavior, sales performance, and business metrics.

# E-commerce Analytics Dashboard – SQL Analysis Explained  

This project is all about exploring e-commerce data using SQL in **BigQuery** to uncover insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and business performance. The SQL queries help break down data to answer key business questions, like:  

- Who are our most loyal customers?  
- Which products sell the most and when?  
- How do seasonal trends affect revenue?  
- Are our marketing campaigns actually working?  

## **How the SQL Code Works**  

The SQL queries in this project focus on **analyzing customer behavior and sales performance** using advanced techniques. Here’s how:  

### **1️⃣ Understanding Customer Behavior**  
The SQL code segments customers based on their purchase habits using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis**. It helps identify:  
- High-value customers who buy often  
- New customers who need engagement  
- Inactive customers who might need a re-engagement campaign  

It also tracks **customer retention** by looking at how many first-time buyers return for future purchases.  

💡 *SQL Techniques Used: Window Functions (LAG, LEAD), Aggregations*  

---  

### **2️⃣ Analyzing Sales Performance**  
The SQL queries calculate **daily, weekly, and monthly sales trends** to show:  
- When peak sales happen (seasonality)  
- Which product categories drive the most revenue  
- Regional sales differences  

💡 *SQL Techniques Used: Time-based Aggregations, Moving Averages, Partitioning*  

---  

### **3️⃣ Product & Inventory Insights**  
By analyzing order data, the SQL code identifies:  
- Best-selling and underperforming products  
- Stock levels to predict when inventory needs restocking  
- How discounts affect product demand  

💡 *SQL Techniques Used: Joins, Aggregations, Pivoting*  

---  

### **4️⃣ Marketing Campaign Effectiveness**  
The queries track customer response to **marketing efforts** by looking at:  
- How many customers return after promotions  
- Which channels drive the most sales  
- How discounts impact customer spending habits  

💡 *SQL Techniques Used: Customer Segmentation, Cohort Analysis*

## **How This SQL Code Optimizes Performance**  
Since working with large e-commerce datasets can be slow, the queries include **performance optimizations**:  
✅ **Partitioning tables** (e.g., by order date) to speed up filtering  
✅ **Using materialized views** to store frequently accessed metrics  
✅ **Optimizing JOINs** to prevent slow query execution  
✅ **Applying efficient indexing strategies** for quick lookups  

---  

## **What You Can Learn from This Project**  
By running the SQL queries, you’ll see real-world insights such as:  
📊 How different customer segments behave  
📈 How seasonal trends affect sales  
🛒 Which products drive the most revenue  
📢 How marketing campaigns impact repeat purchases  

This project is perfect for anyone looking to **master SQL for business intelligence and data analysis**. 🚀
